# OOSD3-Project1
OOSD3, Second Year, Semester 2, Assignment 1
Implement three classes: Repository, Counter, and Publisher
The Repository class should store an integer.
The Counter class should create a thread that starts counting from 0 (0, 1, 2, 3,...) and stores each value in the Repository class.
The Publisher class should create a thread that keeps reading the value in the Repository class and printing it.
Write a program that creates an instance of the Repository class and sets up a Counter and a Publisher object to operate on it.
Update the program from to ensure that each number is printed exactly once, by adding suitable synchronization.
